# Insta Toolbox

Mutual checks, account actions, and DM cleanup, directly on Instagram and stored on your own machine:

- **Mutual Checker** — see who doesn't follow you back, who you don't follow back, and who's mutual.
- **Follow / Unfollow** — work through a list of accounts one at a time, or let the batch runner pace it for you.
- **DM Unsend** — find the messages *you* sent in a conversation and remove them, one or many.

There is no Insta Toolbox account or hosted data service. Imported exports and saved
results stay in local browser storage until you export them. The in-page follower
checker makes read-only, same-origin requests to Instagram using the session
already open in that tab; it never reads, stores, or exports the session value.

## Which version should I install?

| | What you get | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Userscript** (Tampermonkey) | All three tools, including live Follow, Unfollow, and Unsend with paced batch runs. | Fastest start — one click, no build step. |
| **Browser extension** | The same tools, plus pairing with the app for signed, recorded jobs. | Anyone who also uses the app workspace. |
| **Desktop / web app** | The full workspace: import Instagram ZIP exports, snapshots, message search, queue history. | Working with exported data in bulk. |

The userscript and the extension run the **same inspected Instagram engine** —
the userscript is built from the extension's own target-resolution code. Their
delivery and pairing features differ, but their account/message checks share the
same safe-stop rules.

### Quickest start

Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), then open this link and
select **Install**:

**[Install Insta Toolbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slaveofsolace/Insta-AIO-Tool/main/userscripts/insta-aio-companion.user.js)**

Then allow the userscript to run in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions/?id=dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo`.
2. Open Tampermonkey's **Details**.
3. Enable **Allow User Scripts**.

Reload Instagram and press **Alt + Shift + I**. Updates arrive automatically.

Full steps and the other options are in [Installation](./docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## Safety model

Live account changes and DM removal are disabled on every load. Scans,
comparisons, visible evidence, and exact-target dry runs need no unlock. A
destructive run becomes eligible only after one ordinary confirmation naming its
exact action, target or thread, and finite count. That confirmation mints a
non-persistent capability bound to the reviewed targets and expiry; completion,
Stop, expiry, a challenge, a block, a rate limit, or an unexpected state revokes
it. Thread-wide Unsend first performs a no-click conversation check when needed,
then creates a finite plan bound to the exact thread, scope (`all`, `newest`, or
`oldest`), eligible count, digest, and 15-minute expiry. The runner revalidates
the count before accepting only the newly surfaced menu and confirmation control
for each message. Account runs retain only their finite target-bound capability
across the profile navigation they cause in the userscript manager's tab-local
storage; an expired run stops before another action.

The signed PWA path adds stricter one-item controls. A live Follow or Unfollow
requires a fresh signed batch of exactly one item, action permission, one exact
profile/action confirmation, a transient one-use capability, PWA and
extension-side durable reservations, a relationship control inside a verified
profile header, a newly created target-named Unfollow dialog when needed, and
post-action relationship verification. A live Unsend additionally requires a
fresh exact thread/message confirmation for one sent message,
thread/message/timestamp/content-digest/ownership binding, independent PWA and
extension reservations, a one-use rendered-message token, structurally bound
interactive menu/dialog controls, and exact-message removal proof while stable
identity coverage remains available. DOM resolution tokens are issued only by
Web Crypto; if neither `randomUUID` nor `getRandomValues` produces entropy,
inspection returns `secure-random-unavailable` and no capability is stored.

The project does not implement proxy rotation, fingerprint spoofing, challenge bypass, CAPTCHA solving, arbitrary endpoint discovery, mutation-capable endpoint clients, or unreviewed destructive actions.

Insta Toolbox is an independent project and is not affiliated with or endorsed
by Instagram or Meta. Operators are responsible for protecting imported data
and complying with the rules that apply to their accounts and environment.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- Corepack with pnpm 11.9.0, as pinned in `package.json`
- A modern Chromium-based browser for the PWA
- Windows for producing the NSIS installer
- macOS for producing and validating DMG/ZIP releases

## Development

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run assemble
pnpm test
pnpm run serve
```

`pnpm run serve` prints the local address to open in your browser. It listens on
your own machine only and is not reachable from your network.

`pnpm run assemble` rebuilds `src/app.js` from the UI fragments in
`src/app.parts/`. That generated file is not committed, so run it after a fresh
clone or you will get a blank app.

## Import workflow

1. Request a JSON export from Instagram Accounts Center.
2. In **Import / Export**, select the original ZIP.
3. Review the detected paths, file types, expanded sizes, and archive warnings.
4. Confirm the local import.
5. Choose the active relationship snapshot and review comparisons.

Extracted JSON files and folders remain supported as a fallback. Recognized data includes:

- `followers_*.json` and `following*.json`
- Meta `message_*.json` conversation exports
- Instagram Helper `allMessagesItemsArray` data
- SimpleInstaBot followed/unfollowed history
- Saved follower-checker result objects
- Insta Toolbox workspace and snapshot exports

Encrypted archives, unsafe paths, unsupported ZIP variants, integrity errors, and configured size-limit violations are rejected before data is committed.

## Relationship review

The Relationships view identifies mutuals, non-mutual relationships, new followers, detected unfollowers, following changes, and ID-backed username changes.

The queue protects:

- Whitelisted usernames
- Accounts followed before the tool was adopted
- Mutual followers when mutual protection is enabled
- Migration-only history records
- Duplicate or already-completed actions

Follow items enter a configurable waiting period before an unfollow review can become ready.

## Reviewed action jobs

Queue records must be selected explicitly. A preview lists the exact username,
action, duplicates, protected/skipped reasons, and remaining targets for every
finite run. Starting requires one ordinary exact action/target/count confirmation.

Dry runs inspect the current profile without clicking. The adapter safe-stops on
the wrong profile, an unverified profile header, ambiguous controls, any
pre-existing dialog, an unbound Unfollow dialog, session expiry, challenges,
rate limits, action blocks, changed protection state, stale confirmation, or a
missing/expired finite capability. The PWA ledger and the extension's bounded
mirror reserve before the isolated driver call and prevent duplicate or
out-of-plan execution.

Extension 2.0.0 preserves the stricter signed live paths for one reviewed PWA
item while removing typed arm phrases. The PWA sends a signed intent; the
matching Instagram profile or exact sent message must receive one ordinary
action-specific confirmation. The resulting capability exists only in memory,
is consumed before page control, and is paired with a durable reservation that
is finalized as succeeded or uncertain. The PWA independently checkpoints its
transactional ledger. These implemented paths still require authenticated
selector acceptance before issues #3 and #4 can be closed.

## Reviewed DM jobs

Only messages classified as sent by the configured owner can enter a reviewed unsend job. Each item preserves conversation ID, message ID, timestamp, sender ownership, and a content digest.

Live-mode data structures require:

- Complete batch review
- A second destructive confirmation
- Exact conversation and message resolution
- Immediate sender-ownership revalidation
- A durable reservation before the destructive call
- Post-action removal verification

The browser extension performs a true no-click exact-message dry run when the open thread ID matches and one rendered sent row exposes the reviewed message ID, exact timestamp, matching content digest, and sender ownership. Missing stable attributes, duplicate candidates, wrong threads, changed content, and unknown ownership safe-stop. The controlled live path is isolated from that dry-run route: it accepts one fresh twice-confirmed item, consumes an expiring tab-scoped capability before page control, revalidates the same row before each stage, rejects pre-existing menus or dialogs, requires newly surfaced ARIA-bound interactive Unsend controls, and confirms the same-thread target is gone while another stable message identity remains observable. Wrong-thread navigation, identity loss, unbound surfaces, noninteractive text, and unrelated right-aligned descendants all stop uncertain. Authenticated Instagram DOM and action acceptance remain not run, so this is not a claim that issue #4 is closed.

## Companion extension

Build the extension:

```bash
pnpm run build:extension
```

Load `dist/extension` as an unpacked extension, or install the generated ZIP through the appropriate browser-managed workflow.

Open Instagram after loading the extension. A compact **Toolbox** launcher appears
on the right by default; the full overlay opens only when the operator requests
it. On desktop, drag its header to move it, drag the lower-right handle to resize it, and
use **Settings → Surface transparency** to choose 55–100% opacity. Reset restores
the bounded default. On narrow screens it becomes a fitted bottom sheet. It
provides:

- Current-page session, profile, relationship, and queue-match inspection
- One-step authenticated Followers + Following pagination with username autofill/input and a local comparison; list-dialog scanning remains an Advanced fallback
- A review-first account queue that freezes the exact targets before Start becomes available
- Sanitized history for signed account/DM dry runs and controlled one-item results received from the PWA
- Instagram-side transient one-use capabilities for a freshly confirmed signed one-item Follow, Unfollow, or exact sent-message Unsend intent
- Read-only visible-message evidence plus conditional exact-identity DM dry runs that never open a menu
- A direct link back to the exact paired PWA origin

Press **Alt + Shift + I** to toggle the sidecar.

### Tools on Instagram

The sidecar carries the three tools in one place, each on its own tab.

**Mutual Checker.** Confirm the username and choose **Check Followers +
Following**. The shared extension/userscript engine resolves that exact account,
loads both paginated lists through Instagram's authenticated web interface, and
replaces the prior comparison only after both reads finish. It sends no request
outside `www.instagram.com`, never reads or exports cookies, and activates no
page control. The result browser switches among mutuals and both non-mutual
groups and filters locally. If Instagram changes or rejects the read interface,
the Advanced section retains the older exact-dialog scanner as a fallback.

**Follow / Unfollow.** In the Follow / Unfollow tab, choose **Follow people**
or **Unfollow people**, then pick one of the compatible current-profile, checker,
scanned-list, or queue sources. Choose the explicit **Review N Follow targets**
or **Review N Unfollow targets** action to freeze and inspect the exact targets,
duplicates, already-correct relationships, protected/skipped reasons, and
omissions. **Start** appears only while that review still matches the controls.
Each target is opened, re-verified, and acted on one at a time. **Complete** and
**Skip** remain available under the secondary options disclosure.

**DM Unsend.** Open a conversation and choose the always-visible **Unsend DMs**
button. It automatically performs the no-click history check when needed and
must prove a complete finite count before showing one permanent-action
confirmation naming the exact thread and count. The default scope is all
eligible sent messages; `newest N` and `oldest N` are under Advanced. Incomplete
or capped checks do not create a destructive plan. The finite plan is reserved
before the first page control and uses the saved delay range; only rows proven
sent by the current account are eligible.
Cancel preserves the read-only count and changes nothing. Unsending is permanent.

### Batch pacing and safety

Batch runs reuse the audited one-item path: each item still runs a complete
inspect, exact-resolution, reserve, act, and record cycle. One finite capability
is bound to the confirmed target list, consumed by that run, and cannot be
replayed or widened.

- Randomised delays between items, plus a longer rest every 20 items
- Configurable delays under **Settings → Batch pacing**, with a 1.5-second
  minimum and a longer rest every 20 items
- The whole run stops on the first rate limit, checkpoint, block, session
  expiry, or unexpected screen
- A target whose relationship no longer matches is skipped, not forced
- **Stop** aborts before the next item

Automated following and bulk activity can trigger Instagram restrictions.

See
[Instagram sidecar](./docs/INSTAGRAM_SIDECAR.md)
for the runtime and data boundaries and
[Overlay UI implementation](./docs/OVERLAY_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for the
module and migration status. The dedicated screenshot/state matrix, baseline
workflow, and manual acceptance limits are documented in
[Overlay QA](./docs/OVERLAY_QA.md).

Pairing is origin-specific:

1. In the PWA Settings view, create a one-time pairing code.
2. Open the extension popup on the exact PWA origin.
3. Choose read-only access or reviewed dry-run transfer.
4. Paste the code and pair the origin.
5. Return to the PWA and complete the handshake.

The handshake rotates the one-time code into a derived session secret. Messages are signed, time-limited, origin-bound, permission-checked, and protected against nonce replay. Payloads containing session or authorization material are rejected.

## Tampermonkey companion

Install `userscripts/insta-aio-companion.user.js` in Tampermonkey.

The generated script injects a movable, lower-right-resizable, translucent
three-tab toolbox directly on `instagram.com`. It includes the authenticated,
paginated Mutual Checker plus a list-dialog fallback and local comparison, queue and checker target sources for paced Follow
or Unfollow runs, and the source-audited thread-wide DM Unsend runner. It uses the
same exact-target Instagram engine as the extension and remains self-contained:
no remote `@require`, third-party network connector, credential access, or cloud
storage. The checker sends only fixed read-only requests to `www.instagram.com`
with browser-managed credentials; it cannot read or export those credentials.
It explicitly requests the userscript manager's isolated DOM sandbox.
Resumable account runs use `GM_getTab`/`GM_saveTab`, so another Instagram tab
cannot inherit a running batch. Tampermonkey is the supported manager; on a
manager without those tab APIs, follower scanning, comparison, and no-click
checks remain available but account batch execution stays disabled.

Live execution is off on every page load. Each reviewed account run asks once
for its exact action, target list, and count, then mints a finite capability for
that run only. There is no general switch, arm control, or authorization phrase.
The capability expires during a run and is checked before every later item;
account navigation retains only the already-confirmed run and its expiry in the
same manager tab. Thread-wide Unsend separately binds its finite plan to the
current thread and rejects navigation, expired authority, pre-existing menu
decoys, and ambiguous newly opened controls. The
follower scanner, exported comparisons, visible-message scan, and exact no-click
checks work while live controls are locked. The userscript does not include the
extension's signed PWA bridge or its durable workspace ledgers.

## Desktop builds

Create an unpacked desktop build:

```bash
pnpm run pack:desktop
```

Create a Windows NSIS installer:

```bash
pnpm run dist:win
```

Create macOS DMG and ZIP artifacts on macOS:

```bash
pnpm run dist:mac
```

The Electron renderer runs with context isolation, sandboxing, Node integration disabled, denied permission requests, a confined custom protocol, and a restrictive content policy. Local Chromium data is retained across approved upgrades, and up to five startup backups are kept in an app-specific data directory.

See [Installation](./docs/INSTALLATION.md) and [Rollback](./docs/ROLLBACK.md).

## Verification

```bash
pnpm run assemble
pnpm test
pnpm run qa:extension
pnpm run qa:chrome
pnpm run qa:browser:check
pnpm run qa:overlay:check
pnpm run benchmark:zip
```

The automated suite covers imports, migrations, archive limits, reviewed action
and DM jobs, no-click execution, bridge signing and replay protection, extension
permissions, desktop hardening, state migration, service-worker assets, and
large-list rendering. `qa:extension` runs the production content script through
local synthetic Follow, Unfollow, and one-message Unsend DOM fixtures. It also
checks keyboard access, the Chromium accessibility tree, PWA installability,
and read-only pairing defaults. `qa:chrome` loads and pairs the unpacked package
in a disposable Chrome-for-Testing profile. Browser QA exercises every PWA view
at desktop, tablet, and mobile sizes while keeping live settings off.

Use `pnpm run qa:browser:update` only when intentionally accepting a reviewed
visual change. Baselines are platform-specific and actual run output stays under
ignored `test-results`.

The overlay-specific commands rebuild the production extension before loading
its manifest-ordered content scripts in the deterministic Instagram fixture.
Use `pnpm run qa:overlay:update` only for an intentional, manually reviewed
baseline replacement. The 43-state Windows baseline includes fresh-install and
filtered-checker evidence, plus a centered,
resized 62%-opacity proof plus desktop, tablet, mobile, zoom, forced-colors,
collision, locked-action, and review-before-start states. It has been reproduced by
`qa:overlay:check`; CI runs the non-updating check on Windows.
Human screen-reader review, persistent-profile installation, and authenticated
Instagram selector acceptance remain separate operator/release gates.

Windows packaging covers unpacked launch, packaged-renderer smoke, NSIS install,
installed-app launch, and uninstall. CI also builds and smoke-tests macOS DMG and
ZIP packages with QA-only ad-hoc signing. Apple Developer ID signing and
notarization, human screen-reader review, persistent-profile installation, and
any user-selected live Instagram action remain manual release checks.
