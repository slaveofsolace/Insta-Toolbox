# Security review

Last reviewed: 2026-08-20

## Application boundaries

The application is local-first and does not request Instagram credentials or
browser-session values. The PWA and desktop shell process user-selected data
locally. The optional extension uses exact-origin permissions, signed
short-lived requests, nonce replay protection, separate read/action
permissions, and explicit rejection of credential-like payload fields.

Live execution is locked by default. Reviewed account and message jobs use
no-click dry runs by default, exact confirmation material, transactional
reservations, durable checkpoints, and safe stops for ambiguous state.
Execution adapters revalidate the confirmed preview, current enable setting,
and current batch limit before entering a live path.

The local account toolbox also separates review from authority. A deterministic
review signature freezes the selected source, action, limit, and exact target
list. Any input change discards the draft and hides Start; live authorization is
checked only after a matching review exists.

The injected toolbox surfaces follow the same default-off rule. Tampermonkey
does not persist a general live preference, switch, arm control, or typed phrase.
Each already-reviewed account run requires one ordinary confirmation naming its
exact action, targets, and count, then receives a capability bound only to that
finite run. An account run
persists only its original expiry across the profile navigations it causes.
That resumable run is stored through `GM_getTab`/`GM_saveTab`, not the shared GM
record; a manager without tab storage leaves account batches disabled. The
metadata explicitly selects the DOM sandbox so page code does not share
the toolbox's API globals. DM runs are dropped on reload. The shared thread-wide
Unsend runner independently requires a complete no-click history check and a
finite plan bound to the exact thread, scope, eligible count, digest, and future
expiry. It revalidates completeness and count before the first menu and checks
expiry before every page control. The finite plan receives a one-use capability
and uses the saved bounded delay range. It
snapshots existing menu and dialog
candidates and accepts exactly one newly surfaced control. The extension's
thread tool requires one ordinary count-specific permanent-action confirmation.
That DM patch added no host permission, remote dependency,
credential field, private endpoint, or network request.

The follower-checker next pass deliberately adds a narrow authenticated read
client for the exact legacy checker behavior requested by the operator. It can
call only `www.instagram.com/api/v1/web/search/topsearch/` and the exact
`www.instagram.com/api/v1/friendships/<numeric-id>/(followers|following)/`
GET routes. It uses browser-managed credentials without reading them, a fixed
application header, 50-row pages, unique pagination tokens, 800–1499 ms pacing,
25,000-account and 1,000-page limits per list, a shared 20-minute deadline, and
user cancellation. Non-Instagram origins, arbitrary paths, invalid schemas,
login loss, challenges, blocks, rate limits, repeated tokens, and request errors
stop. Results replace both saved lists atomically and are never sent through the
extension bridge.

The PWA service worker uses network-first handling for same-origin GET requests,
caches only successful same-origin responses, bypasses the HTTP cache while
checking for service-worker updates, and deletes earlier cache versions. When
the current origin is reachable, stale cached application code therefore cannot
silently retain an older safety policy.

Each running PWA account or DM execution owns a matching `AbortController` and
an immutable reviewed-job identity. Discard aborts only that matching execution.
The adapters recheck cancellation after every awaited pre-dispatch inspection,
authorization, and reservation boundary. A cancellation after reservation but
before the page driver is durably finalized as `canceled`; the driver is not
called. Atomic checkpoint writers reject a job that no longer exists, so a late
callback cannot resurrect a discarded preview. Once a browser mutation has
already been dispatched it cannot be rolled back: the adapter completes its
postcondition check and records the observed durable outcome instead of
mislabeling it as canceled.

The distributed extension exposes controlled paths for exactly one reviewed
account action or sent-message Unsend. Both require signed action permission, a
fresh reviewed item, matching Instagram context, an exact Instagram-side
phrase, and a tab-scoped 90-second arm. The PWA revalidates the arm before
reserving its ledger. The background worker persists an independent
reservation, then consumes the one-use arm and signed intent before sending the
page-control request.

The account content driver requires a short-lived exact DOM token and one
relationship control owned by a verified profile header. It stops before any
click when a dialog is already visible and accepts only a newly surfaced
Unfollow dialog that names the reviewed username.

The separate reviewed-DM dry-run route requires the matching open direct
thread, one allowlisted
stable rendered message ID, exact timestamp and content digest, a unique
candidate, and sent ownership before recording `resolved-no-click`. Missing,
changed, duplicate, received, wrong-thread, and unknown-ownership states stop
without opening a menu. The route returns no raw message text and cannot reach
the live control activator. The controlled live consumer additionally requires
one ordinary confirmation naming the exact thread and message, exactly one
reviewed item, a matching-thread transient capability, an independent finite
extension ledger, and a one-use row token. It
rejects pre-existing menus or dialogs, revalidates the same row before each
stage, accepts only new ARIA-bound interactive menu/dialog controls with exact
localized Unsend labels, and reports success only when the same thread remains
open, both retained exact nodes disconnect, the exact message is absent, and
other stable identity evidence remains available. Wrong-thread, identity-loss,
unbound-surface, noninteractive-text, and descendant-toolbar ownership fixtures
all fail closed.

Visible DM evidence is scoped to one exact /direct/t/<id> route. The inbox,
feed, profiles, and a different direct thread hide previously captured
fragments immediately and clear the extension's evidence download exposure.
The Tampermonkey shell also filters every saved sent-message batch against the
currently open exact thread before it can show a destructive confirmation.
Client-side Instagram route changes trigger a state rerender; they never inherit
the prior thread's visible evidence or Unsend candidates.

There is no daily action quota. Restored legacy limit fields are normalized for
migration compatibility but are not enforced. Capability replay, stale
confirmation, changed controls, wrong profiles or messages, duplicate attempts,
and ambiguous UI fail closed for both controlled paths.

The reviewed locale surface is isolated in `extension/action-labels.js`, loaded
before the inspector and frozen after initialization. Labels are Unicode NFKC
normalized and compared only against the documented exact allowlists; the
German `zurücknehmen` value is stored as valid UTF-8 and covered by an executable
fixture. Profile and message capability tokens require Web Crypto. Missing,
throwing, invalid, or non-producing `randomUUID`/`getRandomValues` sources return
`secure-random-unavailable`, store no resolution, and cannot reach a page driver.

The extension background derives the requesting origin from Chrome's sender
metadata and rejects a mismatched page claim. The loopback development server
accepts only loopback Host headers and an explicit application-asset allowlist;
repository metadata, tests, documentation, and Git internals are not served.
It sends framing protection as response headers. The PWA meta policy intentionally
omits `frame-ancestors` because browsers ignore that directive in meta-delivered
policies; deployed hosting must likewise supply framing policy as an HTTP header.

Workspace exports can contain imported private data and bridge pairing
secrets. They are explicit user-created backups, not sanitized sharing
artifacts. Pairings should be revoked before a backup is shared.

## Local-patch review closure

The 2026-08-01 controlled-action review found and remediated four low-severity
issues before release: profile controls were not structurally bound to the
reviewed header, an existing Unfollow dialog could be mistaken for a newly
opened target dialog, the extension lacked its own durable reservation, and
malformed restored safety fields could fail open. Regression tests exercise each
fixed boundary. Legacy daily-limit fields now remain only for migration
compatibility and are not enforced. The 2026-08-02 exact-message DM local-patch review reproduced
three bounded live-path defects and one packaging-gate hardening gap. All four
were remediated during the scan, every changed source file received a full-file
receipt, and no reportable finding survives in the current patch. The complete
routing recovery review also reproduced a low-severity discard race across the
PWA handler, asynchronous authorization/reservation, and checkpoint store. The
current patch closes all three layers and adds pre-dispatch, post-reservation,
post-dispatch, non-resurrection, and legitimate-control regressions. The complete
patch also centralizes exact localized action labels as valid UTF-8 and refuses
to issue a profile or message capability when Web Crypto cannot supply entropy.
The 2026-08-08 workflow patch received a complete diff-focused review over ten
changed files plus two supporting safety-contract files. All twelve review
receipts were closed and no plausible security candidate survived discovery.
The 2026-08-20 usability correction received a complete diff-focused review of
all six changed source-like files. It makes the DM plan discoverable and removes
the unrelated global authorization phrase, while keeping the initial live lock,
exact action confirmation, finite plan, reservation, pacing, safe-stop, and
postcondition boundaries. No plausible security candidate survived discovery.
The 2026-08-22 follower-checker pass received route-allowlist, response-shape,
pagination-bound, provenance, atomic-replacement, and fallback-isolation tests.
Authenticated acceptance remains an external release gate; fixture success does
not prove that Instagram still serves these unsupported web routes.
The final 2.0.0 diff review covered the 27 source-like release files in the
security inventory plus all four PWA source fragments. Manifest and package
changes are version-only; no host permission or production dependency was
added. The new credentialed request is confined to the tested same-origin
Followers/Following GET allowlist, and the added userscript anchor activation is
the local comparison download path rather than an Instagram control. Every
destructive entry point remains behind a finite exact confirmation, transient
capability, target revalidation, reservation, pacing, Stop path, and
postcondition check. No plausible security candidate survived discovery.
The repository test suite, extension fixture acceptance, real disposable-Chrome
pairing, nine PWA baselines, the 43-state overlay check, the production
dependency audit, and the 10,000-message ZIP benchmark passed. Native installer
lifecycle and additional-platform gates remain release/CI requirements;
extension packaging independently runs the executable controlled-live safety
subset before creating artifacts.

An authenticated Instagram Follow, Unfollow, or DM action has deliberately not
been run. It remains a separate operator acceptance gate requiring an exact
target, action, and explicit approval. The actual production content script now
passes bounded Follow, Unfollow, and one-message Unsend DOM chains in isolated
Chromium, including accessibility-tree and replay checks. A current authenticated
Instagram diagnostic found one verified `@instagram` profile header and one owned
Follow control without injecting the extension or clicking. Authenticated
rendered-message identity and user-selected mutation acceptance remain open.

## Dependency review

`pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high` reports no known vulnerabilities.
Runtime application code has no third-party production dependencies.

The full development audit reports
[GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg)
through Electron Builder's packaging graph. The advisory range is expressed as
`<=5.0.7`, so it also classifies the separately maintained 1.x and 2.x release
lines as affected.

The lockfile uses the latest major-compatible backports:

- `brace-expansion` 1.1.18
- `brace-expansion` 2.1.4
- `brace-expansion` 5.0.9

All three installed releases contain the aggregate expansion-length bound for
CVE-2026-14257 and enforce it at runtime. Replacing older-major consumers with
5.x would break their CommonJS API contract, so the repository keeps the
major-compatible releases. `pnpm run verify:dependencies`, which is also part of
`pnpm test`, verifies the exact lockfile resolutions, source markers, exported
API, and length-bound behavior. The full-audit alert remains documented until
the advisory metadata recognizes the backports.

## License review

## Release checks

Before publishing a release:

1. Install from the committed lockfile with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
2. Run `pnpm run assemble` and `pnpm test`.
3. Run `pnpm run qa:browser:check` on a platform with a committed baseline.
4. Run `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high`.
5. Run the ZIP-import benchmark.
6. Build and smoke-test the target installer on its native operating system.
7. Review the generated artifacts and release notes for private data.
