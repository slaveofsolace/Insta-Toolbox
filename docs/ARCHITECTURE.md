# Architecture

## System shape

Insta Toolbox is a local-first PWA with three optional delivery surfaces:

1. A self-contained Tampermonkey toolbox with Mutual Checker, no-click review, and exact-confirmed paced actions
2. A Manifest V3 extension with a movable Instagram overlay, local toolbox runs, signed inspection requests, and controlled one-item PWA boundaries
3. A hardened Electron shell for Windows and macOS packaging

The stable data model remains independent of Instagram page markup. Imports, migrations, reviews, protections, checkpoints, and ledgers are implemented as browser-neutral modules.

## Runtime components

### PWA

The PWA owns:

- Offline ZIP and extracted-file import
- Account normalization and deduplication
- Relationship snapshots and comparisons
- Queue scheduling and protection checks
- Message normalization and filtering
- Reviewed account-action and DM job creation
- Local persistence, backup export, and activity history
- Extension pairing and signed request transport

`src/app-loader.js` combines the deterministic source fragments under `src/app.parts/` in memory. `pnpm run assemble` produces the equivalent ignored `src/app.js` file for inspection.

### Import pipeline

`src/core/zip.js` inspects ZIP metadata before extraction. It validates central/local header agreement, CRC values, archive size limits, path safety, compression method, encryption flags, and unsupported ZIP features. `src/workers/zip-import-worker.js` performs extraction away from the UI thread and reports progress and cancellation.

`src/core/import-classification.js` identifies supported records. `src/core/imports.js` routes records to the current Instagram parsers or source-specific migrations. Every source migration returns explicit imported, duplicate, skipped, unsupported, and manual-correction dispositions.

### Relationship engine

`src/core/accounts.js` normalizes account identity.

`src/core/snapshots.js` creates dated follower/following snapshots and calculates mutuals, non-mutual relationships, new followers, lost followers, following changes, and ID-backed renames.

`src/core/queue.js` schedules follow/unfollow reviews and enforces mutual, whitelist, preexisting-follow, status, and migration-history protections.

### Reviewed account actions

`src/core/action-jobs.js` creates immutable previews with exact usernames,
actions, and a digest-bound confirmation record.

`src/adapters/reviewed-action-adapter.js` implements:

- Session inspection
- Exact-profile and relationship validation
- True no-click dry runs
- Immediate protection revalidation
- Ten-minute live-confirmation freshness validation
- One-use extension authorization revalidation before ledger reservation
- Transactional reservation before live driver calls
- Abort-aware revalidation after every awaited pre-driver boundary
- Matching-job discard cancellation with canceled reservation finalization
- Before/after evidence
- Pause, resume, stop, and durable per-item checkpoints
- Safe stops for ambiguous or blocked states

`src/core/action-ledger.js` and `src/adapters/indexeddb-action-ledger.js`
enforce transactional duplicate prevention and checkpoint integrity. Legacy
daily-limit fields are normalized only for migration compatibility and are not
enforced. A checkpoint can update only an existing reviewed job; a callback
arriving after discard fails closed instead of recreating the job. The extension
background keeps an independent reservation mirror so privileged page control
never depends only on a cooperative PWA caller.

### Reviewed DM actions

`src/core/dm-jobs.js` preserves exact conversation ID, message ID, timestamp,
ownership, and content digest for each selected message. A live job requires
completed review plus one ordinary action-specific confirmation.

`src/adapters/reviewed-dm-adapter.js` resolves the conversation and message immediately before a driver call, reserves the attempt transactionally, checkpoints after every item, and verifies removal. Matching discard cancellation is rechecked after every awaited pre-Unsend boundary. A post-reservation cancellation is finalized as `canceled` before any driver call; cancellation after dispatch retains the postcheck and real outcome semantics because Unsend cannot be recalled.

`src/adapters/instagram-dm-unsender.js` adapts safe concepts from the reviewed 0.7.2 source. It accepts only one exact sent-message candidate, one exact localized Unsend option, and a matching confirmation record. It does not copy the source's broad loop or heuristic mass-selection behavior.

The extension's signed DM dry-run route is narrower than the adapter's live
boundary. `content-instagram.js` requires a matching direct-thread ID, one
rendered row with an allowlisted stable message-ID attribute, an exact timestamp
and content digest, and proven sent ownership. The background independently
rechecks every returned identity field before recording `resolved-no-click`.
No message menu or page-control method is reachable from this dry-run route.
Missing or ambiguous identity safe-stops, and authenticated DOM acceptance
remains pending.

### Extension bridge

`src/core/bridge-protocol.js` defines a versioned signed-message format.

Pairing uses:

- An exact HTTP/HTTPS origin
- A 12-byte pairing identifier
- A 32-byte one-time secret
- Separate read and action permissions
- A two-nonce handshake that derives a new session secret

Every request includes a timestamp, request ID, nonce, type, payload, and HMAC-SHA-256 signature. Verification enforces origin, permission, maximum age, replay protection, payload size, and session-material rejection.

The extension background worker serializes bridge requests and persists its replay cache. `action-labels.js` loads first and exposes one frozen normalization/allowlist surface for the reviewed relationship and localized Unsend labels. The Instagram inspector then exposes read-only page inspection. Ordered classic modules under `extension/overlay/` own preferences, routing, theme, bridge transport, downloads, accessibility, collision measurement, the static shell, and five bounded views; `instagram-overlay.js` owns their lifecycle and persistence. The isolated **Insta Toolbox** renders in a closed shadow root after every dependency is available. The deterministic browser fixture explicitly opts into an open root for QA only.

The sidecar owns only browser-local field state:

- A bounded relationship-check workspace that atomically stores both lists,
  subject username, completeness, and authenticated-web or list-dialog provenance
- `insta-toolbox-visible-list` exports for individual raw lists
- An imported `insta-toolbox-manual-queue` and extension-local completion/skip updates
- Read-only visible-message evidence plus conditional stable-identity DM dry runs
- Sanitized pairing and recent dry-run summaries returned by the background worker
- Sanitized pending one-item account and exact-message intents; transient
  capabilities remain in the background worker and are never returned to the page
- A versioned V3 visual preference record; fresh state is collapsed, V1/V2
  choices migrate, and bounded position, size, and opacity fields do not change
  existing capture-export or queue contracts

The PWA remains the system of record for imports, snapshots, comparisons,
protections, reviewed jobs, ledgers, and backups. The background worker never
returns pairing secrets, signatures, or nonces to the Instagram sidecar.

Account dry runs never reach a page-control method. A live account job must be
fresh, signed with action permission, contain exactly one item, and match an
Instagram-side intent. The operator accepts one ordinary confirmation naming the
exact action and username on the matching profile. The resulting transient
capability expires and cannot persist across a worker restart. The background
worker persists its own reservation and consumes the capability before it
sends the single execution request, then finalizes that reservation after the
result. The content script binds the request to a short-lived exact DOM token,
requires one relationship control inside one header that independently names
the pathname account, stops before any click when a dialog is already visible,
and accepts only a newly surfaced Unfollow dialog that names the reviewed
username. It then verifies the resulting relationship. The PWA independently
rechecks the exact readiness before its transactional reservation and checkpoints the
before/after result. DM dry runs use only the separate stable-identity inspector.
The controlled DM path accepts exactly one freshly confirmed sent-message item,
uses a separate signed intent and transient tab capability, reserves independent PWA
and extension ledgers, consumes the capability before the isolated page driver, and
revalidates the exact row before its action menu, localized Unsend option, and
localized confirmation. The menu and dialog must be new, interactive, and
structurally related to their triggering controls. Success requires the same
thread, both retained exact nodes disconnected, the exact candidate absent,
and another stable message identity still available; otherwise both callers
preserve an uncertain outcome. Authenticated selector and live-action acceptance
remain external gates.

Profile and message resolution capabilities require a valid Web Crypto
`randomUUID` or nonzero `getRandomValues` result. A missing, throwing, or
non-producing secure random source returns `secure-random-unavailable`, stores
no token, and therefore cannot reach either controlled page driver.

The overlay view modules do not implement Instagram selectors or page-control
events. They can request a signed reviewed item, a confirmed finite account run,
or a separately confirmed thread-wide Unsend. Execution stays inside the shared
inspected drivers. The thread runner refuses to start without a future capability
expiry and the exact current thread ID. It rechecks both before every page
control, snapshots pre-existing menu/dialog candidates, and accepts exactly one
newly surfaced control for the item it just opened.
Package validation scans the complete ordered graph for unauthorized direct
clicks, synthetic dispatch, recurring polling, remote UI assets, and more than
the audited static shell-markup assignment. An active or just-consumed capability
forces collision-safe presentation so the full panel does not compete with an
exact native control, menu, or confirmation dialog.

### Tampermonkey companion

`scripts/build-userscript.mjs` produces one installable `.user.js` file from the
extension's exact-label module, shared Instagram inspector/action engine, and a
userscript-specific shell. It has no remote `@require`, `@resource`, `@connect`,
third-party connector, or cloud path. The shared checker engine can issue only
its fixed same-origin Instagram relationship GET requests with browser-managed
credentials. The shell stores follower/following drafts, queue state,
pacing settings, and layout preferences in userscript-local storage. The metadata
explicitly selects the userscript manager's isolated DOM sandbox.

The injected toolbox exposes the follower scanner and comparison, no-click
profile/message checks, paced Follow/Unfollow, and thread-wide DM Unsend. Live
execution starts off. Each already-reviewed account run requires one exact
action, target-list, and count confirmation, then receives a non-persistent
capability bound only to that finite run. The expiry is stored only on an already-confirmed account run so the
run can cross its own profile navigations. Resumable account state is held in
manager-provided tab storage (`GM_getTab`/`GM_saveTab`), never in the shared GM
value record; without those APIs, account batches fail closed. DM runs are
dropped on reload, the thread runner rechecks expiry and exact thread identity
before every control, and either surface stops on
expiry, challenge, rate limit, block, session loss, or unresolved identity. The
userscript has no signed PWA pairing or durable workspace ledger; those remain
extension/PWA responsibilities.

### Desktop shell

`desktop/main.mjs` serves packaged assets through a confined custom protocol. The renderer uses:

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `sandbox: true`
- `webSecurity: true`
- Denied permission requests
- Navigation and new-window restrictions
- A restrictive content policy

Electron's app-specific Chromium directory stores the same IndexedDB data used by the PWA. Before the renderer opens, the shell copies available storage directories into a timestamped backup and keeps the five newest backups.

## State model

The current workspace schema is version 3:

```text
snapshots
queue
messages
selectedMessageIds
selectedQueueItemIds
migrationReports
relationshipReports
actionJobs
actionLedger
dmJobs
dmLedger
bridgePairing
settings
activity
importWarnings
```

Migrations are additive. Missing collections receive safe defaults and unknown
extra fields remain available through object spread. Legacy live-setting and
limit fields receive compatibility defaults, but they neither grant action
authority nor impose a DM quota.

IndexedDB is the primary store. LocalStorage is a fallback for environments without usable IndexedDB. Atomic ledger updates use one IndexedDB read/write transaction or a serialized LocalStorage fallback. Reviewed-job checkpoint updates are update-only transactions and reject missing jobs, preventing stale asynchronous writers from undoing discard.

## Trust boundaries

- Imported archives and JSON are untrusted and validated before normalization.
- Imported strings are escaped before HTML rendering.
- Instagram credentials and session material do not enter the PWA.
- The extension pairing secret authenticates local bridge messages only.
- The extension may inspect an existing Instagram tab but does not export its session state.
- A live account capability is scoped to one signed job item, one Instagram tab, one username/action pair, and a 90-second expiry; it is consumed before page mutation.
- Destructive drivers cannot mutate application history directly; they return observations and results that the core validates and checkpoints.
- Exported workspaces and reviewed jobs contain private account/message metadata and should be handled as sensitive personal files.

## Offline behavior

The service worker precaches the shell, UI fragments, core modules, adapters, migrations, and ZIP worker. Imported data is never uploaded by the application. A service-worker cache version change removes older application caches during activation without deleting IndexedDB workspace data.
